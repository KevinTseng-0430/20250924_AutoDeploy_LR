# Project Review Report: Interactive Linear Regression App

**Date**: September 24, 2025
**Scope**: All files within the `C:\Users\user\Desktop\hw1` directory.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This project successfully created an interactive web application for teaching and visualizing simple linear regression, as per the requirements in `ref/idea.md`. The application allows users to dynamically adjust parameters of a linear relationship (such as slope, number of data points, and noise) and observe the model's fitting performance in real-time.

The project followed the CRISP-DM data mining standard process, with clear execution from the business understanding phase to final deployment. The technology stack is centered on Python, utilizing Streamlit for the web framework, Scikit-learn for model training, and Altair for rich, interactive visualizations.

## 2. File Structure Analysis

The project consists of the following key files:

- **`app.py`**:
  - **Purpose**: This is the core application script. It's a Streamlit script responsible for handling the user interface, data generation, model training, and results visualization.
  - **Structure**: The code is well-structured and commented according to the CRISP-DM phases, making it highly readable.

- **`requirements.txt`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines the necessary Python dependencies for the project to run, including `streamlit`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `altair`.
  - **Importance**: This file is crucial for ensuring the application can be deployed correctly, both locally and in the cloud.

- **`log.md`**:
  - **Purpose**: Documents the development process from concept to completion, organized according to the six phases of CRISP-DM (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment).
  - **Value**: Provides a development log and methodological explanation, fulfilling the original requirement to "show the process."

- **`ref/idea.md`**:
  - **Purpose**: The original requirements document for the project. It explicitly requested a Python-based, interactive web application for linear regression that follows the CRISP-DM process.

- **`main.py`** (Obsolete):
  - **History**: This file was created based on a much earlier request (a number guessing game). Within the scope of the current linear regression project, this file is no longer in use, but it remains as a record of the interaction history.

## 3. Functionality and Implementation

- **Interactivity**: The application's sidebar features three sliders, allowing users to instantly adjust the `Slope (a)`, `Number of Points`, and `Noise Level`, providing an excellent user experience.
- **Dynamic Data Generation**: The application does not rely on a static dataset but instead uses NumPy to dynamically generate data conforming to the `y = ax + b + noise` distribution based on user input.
- **Model Fitting**: It uses Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` model to fit the generated data and displays the resulting slope and intercept, comparing them against the true values.
- **Visual Evaluation**: Through an Altair chart, it plots the raw data points (blue scatter), the true relationship line (green dashed line), and the model's fitted line (red solid line) on the same graph, allowing users to visually assess the model's performance under different conditions.

## 4. Development and Deployment Process

- **Development Process**: The project thoroughly followed the CRISP-DM process documented in `log.md`. The steps from defining the problem to building the model and evaluating it visually are clear and well-executed.
- **Local Deployment**: The application can be easily run locally by executing the `streamlit run app.py` command in the terminal.
- **Cloud Deployment**: The project is fully prepared for deployment on the Streamlit Community Cloud. The user only needs to upload the project files (`app.py` and `requirements.txt`) to a public GitHub repository.

## 5. Potential Improvements

1.  **Add Adjustable Intercept**: A slider could be added to allow users to modify the y-intercept `b`, making the tool even more comprehensive.
2.  **Quantitative Metrics**: In addition to visual evaluation, quantitative metrics like **R-squared (RÂ²)** or **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** could be displayed to give users a more precise understanding of model performance.
3.  **Model Comparison**: The application could be extended to include other regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso), allowing users to compare their fitting performance on the same dataset.
4.  **Data Upload Feature**: Allowing users to upload their own small CSV files for analysis would significantly enhance the tool's practical utility.
